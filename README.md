# DataSense

## Mission Statement
Accelerate the spread of machine learning to small- to mid-size companies

## Purpose
One of the largest barriers to companies trying to integrate machine learning into their business is access to a gold standard set of annotated data. We at DataSense want to help businesses overcome that hurdle and thrive with data analytics.

## Design Goals
### Fair Compensation
Your time is valuable â€” we vow to always pay our users fairly

### Data Integrity
Low-quality annotations hurts both sides

### Expansibility
A wealth of annotation types will attract the best clients

### Ease of Use
Simple interfaces accelerate the rate of annotation

## Setup
### REST API Server
Found in _src/ExpressREST_, you will need node and npm installed and an instance of mongo running.
```
npm install
node index.js
```

### Java Server
Found in _src/DataSenseReact_, you will need an up to date version of Java RT installed.
```
./gradlew build # to build 
./gradlew bootRun # to run
```

### Static File server
All static files can be found in _src/frontEnd_, where you can use any HTTP server you like. We suggest python! :)
```
cd ../../frontEnd
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
